# AC2D

**AC2D** is a computational package designed for atomistic-to-continuum (a/c) coupling methods, specifically for simulating and analyzing crystalline defects. This package is primarily developed and maintained by **Mingjie Liao** and **Yangshuai Wang**.

### Features

With **AC2D**, you can construct various coupled atomistic-to-continuum meshes for different types of defects, including:
- **Point Defects**: such as vacancies, microcracks, and Frenkel defects.
- **Dislocations**: including both screw and edge dislocations.

For example:
- The a/c mesh for a Frenkel defect:

- The a/c mesh for a single edge dislocation:

### Supported Methods

This package supports multiple atomistic-to-continuum coupling methods, enabling you to simulate, compare, and analyze their performance:
- **Blended Energy-based Quasi-Continuum (BQCE) Method**
- **Blended Force-based Quasi-Continuum (BQCF) Method**
- **Atomistic/Continuum Blending with Ghost Force Correction (BGFC) Method**
- **Geometric Reconstruction Atomistic-to-Continuum (GRAC) Method**

Using these methods, you can compute and visualize the convergence of each method with respect to the degrees of freedom (DoFs). Hereâ€™s an example of convergence analysis:

### Adaptive Algorithms

AC2D also includes adaptive algorithms for atomistic-to-continuum coupling methods, enabling efficient mesh refinement based on error estimation. For detailed examples and usage, refer to the [README](./examples/README.md).
